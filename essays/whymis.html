  <p>Just as most of my friends, high school was a time about fun and playing sports. Academics were of importance, but not nearly as being in all sorts of clubs or sports to gain leadership roles. Most afternoons were filled with some sort of after school sport or club activity that my friends and I had to plan. Our senior year of high school we chose pathways to help guide us to the fields we would end up in as adults, or college students. Everyone stuck to their paths, a vast majority of them either in the health field or choosing some sort of engineering which made it easy for them to choose and apply to colleges. However, I struggled. I applied to all sorts of college with out a clue of knowing what I wanted to do, then the University of Hawaii at Manoa had reached out and offered me admittance to the Shidler College of Business as a first year.</p>

<p>After turning in my application I was very unsure about if this was something that I wanted to do or if I just wasted my time applying instead of going away to play college ball. I came into my first year being set-and-stone about being an accountant, and had tunnel vision when it came to it. Turns out accounting is rather boring and looking at numbers all day are not as fun as it is made out to be. I tried to stick it out but in the end I couldnâ€™t. I folded and decided to major in something else. I told myself I did not want to do marketing, but I needed a challenge. I spoke to my advisor about my options and she suggested either finances or MIS.</p>

<p>The choice was obvious. In my mind I was going to suffer either way, look at numbers all day and bore myself or struggle with technology but also improve on a skill that I do not possess. Although I am heavily intimdated by the course due to my lack of knowledge as well any competence when it comes to using a computer, I look forward to the experiences, knowledge and connections I may be able to gain from this course as well as the long nights, tears that will be shed and the obscenities to be thought.</p>
