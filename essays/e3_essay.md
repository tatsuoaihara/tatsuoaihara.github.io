The last WOD that was required to be completed before this essay was "Invoice1". This was about creating a table with the quantities and prices of things that people wanted, with a total, the tax they owe as well as the grand total. https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html is the provided link to get the info and instructions needed to complete the assignment. This WOD was much more simple than some of the prior ones because the instructions were more clear and it was a lot easier to get into the Rx category.

In my experiences for completing this WOD, it was rather simple and did not have very much struggle. The only thing that stopped me was formatting the table and having to use "\$" for the tables as I kept forgetting to do so. Because I has to use the forward slash and another "$" to denote it as a reference than part of a string, because of the reoccuring code, I did not do it all the time resulting in failure and incompletion the first few times until I finally remembered to do so.

My process for this was to read through the entire directions and decipher which part I would get stuck on before even attempting so I can anticipate how much time I would need to figure it out, if not I would have to watch the screencast to help get me unstuck. The preparation of reading through the whole thing first did help and was the only thing I did change from my other WODs and their attempts.

I definitely think that I could have read up a little more about strings and the components needed to make then run properly, as seen by my struggle with the curly braces, back ticks and the denotation of the extra dollar signs. I also feel understanding concepts in full would help more, I do not completely understand concepts we are learning in full sometimes and just roll with it so I do not get left in the dust. Although this WOD was signifcantly less stressful and anxiety inducing than the previous, there still are a plethora of things I should work on and consider to make sure I can complete theses things more efficiently.
