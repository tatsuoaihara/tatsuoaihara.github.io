  <p>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
  My store is a candy store that sells generic candy from large named companies at an extremely high price. We sell favorite chocolates like Snickers, Twix and even Almond Joy (guh-ross). Along with that, we now offer a larger selection such as regular gummies and sour gummies. We sell the sought out 5lb gummies that your kids will be sure to enjoy.</p>

<p>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
  I still was unable to figure out the simple things such as removing and updating the quantities available after adding them to the cart, as well as had some troubles with the nodemailer section of this assignment.</p>

<p>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
  I am most proud of my login and logout feature which Professor Port helped me to design upon some brainstorming. When a user is logged in the link shows “Logout ${User}” and when no one is logged in, it says “Login” until there is someone who is registered logged in. This works on all my pages due to the fact of sessions and cookies and destroying them after signing out.</p>

<p>Describe what you are least happy with your system:
  I would’t say that I am least happy with anything to be honest. I feel that regardless of the caliber in which my submission is deemed, for me it is superb in the sense that I did not know how to code less than 6 months ago. Therefore, as crumby as it may be to others, I do feel that it is cool and higher than my expectations.</p>

<p>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
  This was different in the sense that, you needed less code than you thought and found myself deleting more lines of code than I was putting in most of the time. This also had more convenience due to cookies and sesssions now being available to us making it easier to retrieve and hand data back to the user.</p>

<p>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
  I used Google first, particularly W3 schools, then broke it down with the help of ChatGPT, and if I could not understand or do it then, I then emailed the professor to ask for help.</p>

<p>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
  Reading and thinking about how I wanted the assignment to come out helped alot. This was due to the fact that I had a layout or idea to go off of and help me to think of other alternatives. This also helped professor give me recs into my situation and how to make it better.</p>

<p>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
  Just jumping into the code and plugging code in did not work at ALL. This honestly caused me more trouble and the presence of syntaxes more than it offered to help. I also did not know what some of the code did so I would have redundant code at times when I did not understand what I copied and pasted.</p>

<p>What did you learn from doing this assignment?
  I learned that coding is often simpler than what you think it is, and often does not require a lot of complex thinking because the computer is not that smart either. When you overthink it, it becomes harder and makes it more difficult because you try to put all these ideas into code and make it into a big mess of cords.</p>

<p>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
  Nothing. I feel that all the errors and mistakes I made helped me to understand a the code just a little bit more than I would have if I did not make them.</p>

<p>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
  a) 50% easily. I spent so much time thinking about what I needed to do and overcomplicated them in such a manner that I did not even know what I coded when I went back to look at it.
  b) 35% of my time was spent typing code out due to the fact that there just was alot of things I had to edit or change to make code fit to my specific variables and code I already had.
  c) The last 15% was spent testing code. Luckily for this assignment the code I was used was correct for the most part meaning that I did not have to test it too many times before I got it to work the way it should have.</p>

<p>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
  I worked on the entire thing. I chose to not have a partner because I did not finish Assignment 2 on time and refused to look at Assignment 3 til I finished up the previous since it built off of it.</p>
