My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
My programming has improved in many, many ways. At the beginning of the semester I probably couldn't code more than a few lines before stressing and freaking out about certain things. To say the least, I was not a good programmer at the beginning of this course, neither am I now. However, I have come a long way from before. I can now build a products array and insert it into an html file, I can also assign an id to an object. I also think that i some ways my programming has improved as I can now write loops moretheless. Those are just a few, among many things, that I have improved upon since beginning this class.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Just as how I improved in many ways, there are still many things I need to improve upon. I need to work on understanding what each thing does, how braces, brackets and parentheses work and when to use them. I also need to work on making my code more easy to read rather than have it come from all over. This will improve both efficiency and understanding as I can see the step-by-step process versus having to jump from place to place, confusing me in the process.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
This is partially true. I feel that I still do need the aide of a screencast for the later WODs as I am not super proficient in coding languages. I think the very first ones I can do without a screencast, and as we progress throughout the latter I may still need to request one to help me get past a certain point. I say this because for SPP3 and Store1, they took me a lot longer than I wish they would have taken me because I got stuck for a while and needed the help of Professor Port. Meanwhile, I feel the very first ones we did up until maybe SPP2, I may be able to do without much problems or a screencast.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
I do feel that I learned alot from the labs and can somewhat complete them with confidence. I do however feel that just reading and taking quizzes do not show how well we understand and know these things because once you do them, its stored in the back of your mind which you won't use until it is needed in class. I feel to help with this, there should be smaller assignments that apply things in deeper steps which allow for students, like myself, to better comprehend things and not feel lost for a large majority of the time.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
I do not feel ready to work on Assignment2. I feel that I did learn a lot from Assignment 1, but I also feel that it was a huge step and took a lot out of us as students and the professor himself. I think that there should be a larger gap of time before attempting and having Assignment2 assigned and due because of how long Assignment1 took. Regardless, I did learn a lot more than I thought from Assignment1 and do not have much choice as to starting Assignment2.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I feel that my learning in this class can be improved through a slower pace of learning, as I think most of my peers can agree to as well. I feel this class is essentially our first actual coding class and not a lot of us had a firm grasp to start, so being thrown into the deep end at the start was a sink or swim battle. I do feel that the class is taught well for what is needed to be covered, but I wish that the labs were less frequent as they are a lot to take in and do take a while to complete. I also think having reviews of the material would help as there is a lot of info in which we need to understand to apply things thoroughly, and there are also other classes we have to attend to.

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
I feel that WODs, one-on-one and working with classmates do help the most. WODs help to apply everything at once, but I do feel that having more than one at a time is counter-intuitive to our learning as the information and application does not really soak in as you jump from one assignment straight to the next. One-on-one is definitely the most effective as you can say things that you feel are correct and have the professor explain to you why it is or isn't correct. This was definitely the go to when I got stuck because then it was a for sure way that I could get the help that I needed and be able to complete most, if not all of it. Working with classmates also helps, because rather than sitting there and not knowing what to code or program next, you can bounce ideas off of each other in an attempt to get the tasks done.
