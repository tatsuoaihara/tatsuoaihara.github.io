Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
A2 link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html
In this assignment we learned how to do many things like in A1. From this assignment we learned how to track people's login, register new users as well as validate them to make sure they line up and can be used as actual accounts. This is a continuation off of A1 and builds many things, such as a login and registration page which are used to track the quantities the customers wish to purchase from your online store.

What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned how to add new users, as well as create a login page for users to follow in order to secure their quantities they wish to purchase. I also learned that you need to set aside more time for these assignments as they take a lot of time, and do require more time set aside to understand and re-learn things that we just touched on. 

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner on this. I did seek Port's help more often than not as I did have alot of errors for this assignment. I do feel having a partner to help would be useful and could have made this a lot easier, but also did not get to start the assignment til aftr returning from my trip, thus this is being turned in so late. 

How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I needed help alot. I got help through Port, mostly with validations and simple errors when I misspelled or used the wrong properties, such as strings, objects, or even had simple trailing commas. When I asked Port for help, it was with validations because I struggle so much with them, along with simple things like fixing the format of the page, or even to check over my code because I put spelling errors.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
This was different because not only did you need to have a working website, you needed to create a login and registration page that worked, which then was stored in a file and could be used to log them in to track the amount of selected quantities they wanted.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
For this project, I say I easily spent 10-11 days working on this assignment due to all the errors and not fully understanding everything that was being asked of me for this assignment. 

(a) I say I spent about 15% of my time on this assignment just thinking or brainstorming about how to do something.
(b)Writing code took me about 30-35% of my allocated time for this as I did struggle and had to go back to learn certain concepts when I got stuck.
(c) The rest of the time I spent coding and debugging which was a pain since I had a hard time understanding some parts so I had to go back to re-read things so I could try to fix and get the tests to work.

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
In all honesty, not a lot worked well for me throughout this project. I struggled a lot more on this assignment than A1 due to the new implications we needed and not having been here for a bit of it. But the thing that worked well for me was saving all the CSS stuff til the end and baring the ugliness of a white background. 

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back, I would start the project earlier and ask for help earlier and teach myself some things to make sure I had some understanding before being thrown into the deep end of the pool. Specifically for the reason of validations as they caused me the most trouble since I was thinking too complex about certain things making them that much harder to do.
